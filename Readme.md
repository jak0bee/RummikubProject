To initiate our program, the user needs to navigate to src -> main -> java -> com -> gameEngine and open the gameEngine class. 
After clicking the run button, the user gets a choice between single player and multiplayer modes. Single player allows for 
playing against our ai agents. When the user clicks the single player button, he gets transfered to the name selection page. 
If the textfields are not empty, the user should click the "start game" button in order to initiate the game. If the user choses 
multiplayer mode, he first needs to select the number of players (between 2 and 4). After submitting, the name selection page 
appears again. In multiplayer mode, there is an additional constraint that the nicknames of 2 players cannot be the same. After 
clicking "start game button", the game starts.
